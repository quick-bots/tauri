## Review Types

Different review types may be appropriate based on the document and current project phase:

1. **Full Review**
   - Complete assessment of the entire document
   - Checks for accuracy, completeness, and consistency
   - Recommended after major project milestones

2. **Incremental Review**
   - Focuses on sections added or modified since the last review
   - Checks integration with existing content
   - Recommended for routine bi-weekly or weekly reviews

3. **Technical Review**
   - Focuses on technical accuracy and feasibility
   - Conducted by subject matter experts
   - Recommended for SDD, API, and technical sections of other documents

4. **Consistency Review**
   - Focuses on cross-document consistency
   - Uses automated tools to check references and terminology
   - Recommended monthly for all documents

5. **AI-Assisted Review**
   - Uses Claude or other AI tools to analyze documentation
   - Helps identify gaps, inconsistencies, and areas for improvement
   - Supplements but does not replace human review

## Review Process

Follow this process for all scheduled reviews:

### Preparation

1. Reviewer creates a branch for the review: `review/doc-name-YYYYMMDD`
2. Reviewer checks for recent changes to the document
3. Reviewer identifies related documents that may need consistency checking

### Review Execution

1. Reviewer uses the appropriate [Review Template](review_template.md)
2. For technical documents, reviewer consults with subject matter experts as needed
3. For consistency reviews, reviewer runs the consistency check script
4. For AI-assisted reviews, reviewer submits document to Claude using the AI review template

### Review Documentation

1. Reviewer completes the review template with findings
2. Reviewer creates a GitHub issue for each major issue identified
3. Reviewer creates a pull request with recommended changes

### Follow-up

1. Document owner addresses issues according to priority
2. Document owner updates document with required changes
3. Document owner updates document metadata including version and last review date

## Review Assignments

2. No document should be reviewed by its primary author
3. Reviews should be distributed across the team to share knowledge
4. Each team member should participate in at least one review per month

## Tracking and Metrics

Documentation quality and review effectiveness will be tracked using the following metrics:

1. **Issue Resolution Rate**: Percentage of identified issues resolved
2. **Document Update Velocity**: Time from issue identification to resolution
3. **Review Coverage**: Percentage of documents reviewed according to schedule
4. **Documentation Quality**: Number of issues found per review

## Tools and Resources
