# Documentation Gap Analysis
Version: 1.0.0
Date: 2025-02-28

## Overview
This analysis identifies gaps and inconsistencies across all project documentation, based on automated consistency checks and manual review.

## Critical Gaps
*List of critical gaps that require immediate attention*

1. Version Control Issues
   - Only SDD has explicit version (1.0.0)
   - Other documents missing version numbers
   - Version synchronization needed with Project Overview

2. Coverage Issues
   - Low phrase coverage across most documents (0-74.63%)
   - Term coverage below 60% in all documents
   - SDP missing 4% of requirements

## Terminology Inconsistencies
*Terms used differently across documents*

| Term | Project Overview | SRS | SDD | SDP | API |
|------|-----------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| AI Integration | Comprehensive | Limited | Detailed | Basic | API-focused |
| Performance Metrics | P95 defined | Missing | Partial | Missing | Endpoints only |
| Security Model | TPM, TLS | Basic | Detailed | Process | API Auth |

## Missing Requirements By Document
*Requirements from Project Overview missing in other documents*

### SRS (33.16% term coverage)
- Missing AI configuration and error handling terms
- Limited coverage of agent-related terminology
- Security and authentication terms underrepresented

### SDD (55.75% term coverage)
- Highest coverage but still missing key technical terms
- Good phrase coverage (74.63%)
- Needs alignment with Project Overview on AI components

### SDP (29.99% term coverage)
- Missing 4% of requirements
- Very low phrase coverage (1.49%)
- Development process terminology gaps

### API (34.87% term coverage)
- Limited phrase coverage (23.88%)
- Missing key API error messages
- Endpoint documentation needs expansion

## Action Items
*Specific updates needed to resolve identified gaps*

1. Version Control (High Priority)
   - [ ] Add version numbers to SRS, SDP, API docs
   - [ ] Align all versions with Project Overview
   - [ ] Add changelog sections to all documents

2. Documentation Alignment (High Priority)
   - [ ] Update SDP to cover missing 4% requirements
   - [ ] Enhance phrase coverage in SRS and SDP
   - [ ] Standardize AI/Agent terminology across docs

3. Content Enhancement (Medium Priority)
   - [ ] Add missing error messages to API doc
   - [ ] Expand security model documentation
   - [ ] Standardize performance metrics across docs

## Next Steps
1. Present findings to technical lead for review
2. Create standardized templates for missing sections
3. Schedule team review for terminology standardization
4. Begin systematic updates starting with version control

## Review Status
- [x] Initial Analysis Complete
