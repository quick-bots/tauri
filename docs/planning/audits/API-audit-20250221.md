# API Documentation Audit Findings

## Identified Alignment Issues

1. **MCP Integration Gaps**  
   - Missing context isolation requirements from Project Overview §4.6.3
     - ✓ Added `MCPContext` interface with security levels and resource quotas
     - ✓ Implemented context validation in client operations
   - No documentation of MCP resource discovery patterns
     - ✓ Added `ResourceDiscovery` interface with scan and inspect operations
   - Tool chaining interface not specified
     - ✓ Added `ToolChaining` interface with chain, validate, and execute operations

2. **Security Implementation Conflicts**  
   - Authentication section marked as placeholder vs Project Overview's @enforce directives
     - ✓ Updated authentication section with @enforce directive and concrete implementation details
   - No ACL documentation for Tauri commands
     - ✓ Added CommandACL interface with granular permission controls
   - Missing resource write restrictions from §4.6.3
     - ✓ Implemented in MCPContext and ResourceDiscovery interfaces

3. **Port Standard Violations**  
   - MCP ports not documented (Project Overview §4.6.1)
     - ✓ Added port standards section with MCP service ports (8001, 8002)
   - Tauri service ports undefined
     - ✓ Documented Tauri development port (1420)
     - ✓ Added WebSocket and Security service ports (8003, 8004)

4. **Error Handling Discrepancies**  
   - Missing MCP-specific error conditions:
     - ✓ Added CONTEXT_BREACH error code
     - ✓ Added QUOTA_EXCEEDED error code
     - ✓ Added MODEL_INCOMPATIBLE error code
     - ✓ Added additional security and UI/UX related error codes

5. **UI/UX Implementation Risks**  
   - No API support for:
     - ✓ Added buddy list status indicators via BuddyStatusUpdate interface
     - ✓ Added AIM-style chat window management events
     - ✓ Added real-time agent activity updates with thinking/response handlers

6. **Tooling Integration Omissions**  
   - tauri-plugin-log integration not specified
     - ✓ Added security logging configuration using tauri-plugin-log
   - MCP Inspector requirements from §5.4 missing
     - ✓ Implemented in ResourceDiscovery.inspect method
   - Security service crypto standards undefined
     - ✓ Added specific encryption algorithms (AES-256-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305)
     - ✓ Added Ed25519 for digital signatures
     - ✓ Added key rotation and backup functionality

## Recommended Corrections

1. Add MCP context isolation requirements table
2. Document Tauri ACL configuration for all commands
3. Align port assignments with Framework Authority standards
4. Expand error handling with MCP-specific cases
5. Add UI event API endpoints for AIM features
6. Specify security service implementation details

## Status Update
All identified issues have been addressed in the API documentation. The changes maintain alignment with:
- Project Overview specifications
- Framework best practices
- Security requirements
- UI/UX design references

Next steps:
1. Review updated documentation for completeness
2. Begin implementation of the specified interfaces
3. Create test cases for new functionality
4. Set up monitoring for the defined ports
