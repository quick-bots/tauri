# API Documentation Audit Findings (2025-02-24)

## Identified Inconsistencies with Project Overview

1. **MCP Integration Requirements**  
   - Project Overview §3.2.1: Requires context isolation boundaries between AI models  
   - API.md §2.1: Missing validation hooks for cross-context communication
     - ✓ Added ContextIsolationGuard interface
     - ✓ Implemented validateCrossContextRequest method
     - ✓ Added auditContextAccess for tracking
     - ✓ Added enforceIsolationBoundaries method
   
2. **Security Implementation**  
   - Project Overview §4.3: Mandates hardware-backed key storage  
   - API.md §4.2: SecurityService uses software-based key rotation without TPM integration
     - ✓ Added HardwareSecurityModule interface
     - ✓ Implemented TPM-backed key operations
     - ✓ Added key attestation support
     - ✓ Updated SecurityService to use HSM

3. **UI/UX Event Handling**  
   - Project Overview §2.4: Requires AIM-style window docking support  
   - API.md §5.1: ChatWindow interface lacks dockingPosition property
     - ✓ Added DockingPosition type
     - ✓ Extended ChatWindow with position and docking properties
     - ✓ Added window snap-to-grid support
     - ✓ Implemented docking event handlers

4. **Error Recovery Patterns**  
   - Project Overview §5.1.3: Specifies automatic model fallback procedure  
   - API.md §6: Error handling lacks MODEL_FALLBACK error code and recovery hooks
     - ✓ Added MODEL_FALLBACK error code
     - ✓ Added recovery options in ErrorResponse
     - ✓ Implemented autoFallback configuration
     - ✓ Added retryStrategy options

5. **Tool Chaining Implementation**  
   - Project Overview §3.4.2: Requires visual pipeline validation  
   - API.md §2.2: ToolChaining.validate() returns boolean instead of visual markup
     - ✓ Added ValidationMarkup interface with visual annotations
     - ✓ Implemented PipelineVisualization interface
     - ✓ Added pipelineDiagram method
     - ✓ Enhanced validate() to return visual feedback

## Audit Validation Checklist

- [x] All MCP boundaries match isolation requirements from §3.2
- [x] Key management aligns with hardware security specs from §4.3
- [x] Window management implements AIM docking behaviors from §2.4
- [x] Error recovery matches automated procedures in §5.1.3
- [x] Tool chaining validation provides visual feedback per §3.4.2

## Status Update
All identified inconsistencies have been resolved in the API documentation. The changes maintain alignment with:
- Project Overview specifications
- Security requirements
- UI/UX design references
- Error handling patterns
- Visualization requirements

Next steps:
1. Review updated API documentation with engineering team
2. Create implementation tickets for new interfaces
3. Update test plans to cover new functionality
4. Schedule security review for TPM integration
