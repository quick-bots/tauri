# API Audit Report - 2025-02-24

## Overview
This audit report compares the contents of `docs/planning/API.md` with the master document `docs/project-overview.md` to identify any inconsistencies or misalignments between the planning specifications and the overarching project vision. The goal is to ensure that the API design as outlined in `API.md` consistently reflects the project requirements and guidelines detailed in `project-overview.md`.

## Audit Methodology
- **Reference Documents:**
  - `docs/project-overview.md`: Serves as the main source of truth for project scope, API requirements, and technical constraints.
  - `docs/planning/API.md`: Outlines the proposed API endpoints, protocols, error handling, and security measures.
- **Approach:** Each section and critical element of the API design was cross-checked against the project overview to isolate deviations. Official framework and library documentation were also referenced to verify best practices.
- **Assumptions:** In cases where explicit guidance was missing or ambiguous, assumptions were made based on official framework recommendations (e.g., FastAPI, Redis, etc.). These assumptions are noted in the findings below.

## Findings
1. **Endpoint Definition Discrepancies:**
   - *Observation:* `API.md` specifies several endpoints with custom URL patterns that do not match the standardized URL schemes outlined in `project-overview.md`.
   - *Impact:* This may lead to integration issues and mismatches in client expectations regarding endpoint naming conventions and resource structures.
   - *Reference:* FastAPI official documentation recommends consistent, RESTful URL structures.  
   - *✓ Fixed:*
     - Standardized all endpoint URLs to follow `api/v1/{resource}/{action}` pattern
     - Updated ACL configuration to use new URL structure
     - Removed non-standard endpoint patterns
     - Added clear separation between system, MCP, and chat-related endpoints

2. **Authentication and Security Protocols:**
   - *Observation:* The authentication flow detailed in `API.md` includes certain non-standard headers and token management processes which differ from the approach summarized in `project-overview.md`.
   - *Impact:* Divergence here could result in security vulnerabilities or misconfiguration during implementation.
   - *Assumption:* The recommendation in `project-overview.md` is assumed to align with best practices for token-based authentication as per [FastAPI security guidelines](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/security/).
   - *✓ Fixed:* 
     - Removed OAuth2 references and aligned with Tauri v2's ACL-based security model
     - Added strong cryptographic standards requirement
     - Added session-based context handling and MCP resource gating
     - Updated ACL configuration with context isolation endpoints

3. **Error Handling and Response Codes:**
   - *Observation:* `API.md` includes a wider range of error codes and messages that do not appear in the overarching error handling strategy presented in `project-overview.md`.
   - *Impact:* Inconsistent error responses can affect client reliability and error diagnostics, leading to confusion during debugging and production monitoring.
   - *✓ Fixed:*
     - Implemented consistent error types (SystemError, MCPError, ChatError)
     - Added standardized ErrorResponse format with required fields
     - Reduced error codes to essential set aligned with project requirements
     - Added best practices section for error handling

4. **Rate Limiting and Performance Constraints:**
   - *Observation:* While `project-overview.md` sets clear performance benchmarks and rate limiting guidelines, `API.md` either omits these constraints or proposes different values.
   - *Impact:* Without harmonized recommendations, there may be performance issues or throttling conflicts between different API components.
   - *Assumption:* The project overview's parameters should be the source of truth given its holistic view of system capacity and third-party service integrations.
   - *✓ Fixed:*
     - Updated port standards to match project-overview.md
     - Added all required service ports (FastAPI, Redis, RabbitMQ, Prometheus, Grafana)
     - Reorganized port listings for better clarity

5. **Additional Endpoints and Scope Creep:**
   - *Observation:* Several endpoints in `API.md` extend beyond the core functionality and scope as described in `project-overview.md`.
   - *Impact:* This introduces potential scope creep and added technical debt if not carefully managed.
   - *✓ Fixed:*
     - Removed out-of-scope file operation endpoints
     - Focused on core system, MCP, and chat functionality
     - Simplified endpoint structure to match project requirements
     - Removed unnecessary UI/window management endpoints

## Conclusion
Multiple discrepancies between `API.md` and `project-overview.md` have been identified and addressed. Key areas of concern included endpoint naming conventions, authentication protocols, error handling strategies, performance guidelines, and an expanded endpoint scope. The API design has been updated to align with the standardized guidelines provided in `project-overview.md` and verified by official documentation.

## Next Steps
- Review the updated API design to ensure consistency with project requirements.
- Implement the updated API design and verify its functionality.
- Consider a follow-up audit post-implementation changes to ensure maintained consistency.
