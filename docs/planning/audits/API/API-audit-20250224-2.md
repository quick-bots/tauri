# API Audit Report - 2025-02-24

This document outlines the audit findings comparing the contents of `API.md` with the main source of truth `project-overview.md`. These findings are intended to highlight inconsistencies and areas requiring alignment before proceeding with implementation.

---

## 1. Overview

The purpose of this audit is to ensure that the API planning document (`API.md`) aligns with the project's overarching specifications as described in `project-overview.md`. Any deviations or inconsistencies identified herein should be reviewed and resolved in accordance with official framework recommendations and best practices.

## 2. Audit Findings

### 2.1 Endpoint Naming and Structure

- **Issue:** The API endpoints listed in `API.md` use naming conventions and URL structures that differ from those outlined in `project-overview.md`.
- **Details:**
  - `project-overview.md` specifies a standardized structure for endpoint paths (e.g., consistent use of versioning such as `/v1/...`), while `API.md` contains endpoints without version prefixes.
  - This inconsistency could lead to confusion in routing and version management.
- **Recommendation:** Adopt the naming and versioning scheme as detailed in `project-overview.md`.
- **✓ Fixed:** Added `/v1` prefix to all endpoints in the ACL configuration and command definitions
  - Updated system endpoints to `/v1/system/status` and `/v1/app/version`
  - Updated file operation endpoints to `/v1/files/save` and `/v1/files/read`
  - Updated MCP endpoint to `/v1/mcp/invoke`

### 2.2 HTTP Methods and Semantic Alignment

- **Issue:** There are discrepancies in the prescribed HTTP methods for certain actions. For example, some endpoints in `API.md` use `POST` for actions that are typically defined as `GET` in `project-overview.md`.
- **Details:**
  - The overview document advocates for RESTful practices, emphasizing the correct use of HTTP methods as per RFC 7231.
  - Misalignment here might lead to misinterpretation by API consumers regarding data mutations vs. data retrieval.
- **Recommendation:** Review and align the HTTP method usage in `API.md` with RESTful best practices and the guidelines in `project-overview.md`.
- **✓ Fixed:** Added proper documentation citations for RESTful practices and updated command permissions to reflect proper HTTP method usage

### 2.3 Authentication and Authorization

- **Issue:** The authentication mechanisms outlined in `API.md` differ from the strategy described in `project-overview.md`.
- **Details:**
  - `project-overview.md` emphasizes a token-based authentication system that leverages industry-standard practices, whereas `API.md` includes references to session-based authentication.
  - This inconsistency can lead to integration issues and security concerns.
- **Recommendation:** Standardize the API authentication method to the token-based approach as detailed in `project-overview.md`.
- **✓ Fixed:** 
  - Updated authentication section to specifically use JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
  - Added OAuth2 with Bearer token scheme
  - Added citation to FastAPI Security Documentation
  - Removed references to session-based authentication

### 2.4 Error Handling and Response Formats

- **Issue:** Variations exist in error response formats and status codes between the two documents.
- **Details:**
  - The main overview mandates a uniform error response structure (including error codes, messages, and metadata), but several endpoints in `API.md` appear to have custom and disparate error formatting.
- **Recommendation:** Reconcile the error handling approach in `API.md` to match the uniform structure specified in `project-overview.md`.
- **✓ Fixed:**
  - Added standardized `ApiError` interface
  - Implemented consistent error response format with status codes
  - Added proper error handling in file operations
  - Added citation to FastAPI error handling guidelines

### 2.5 Documentation Consistency and Citations

- **Issue:** `API.md` sometimes lacks clear citations or references to official documentation for certain design choices, contrasting with the more rigorously documented standards in `project-overview.md`.
- **Details:**
  - The overview document cites relevant framework documentation (e.g., FastAPI guidelines) and other official sources for best practices. This level of documentation is not consistently seen in `API.md`.
- **Recommendation:** Enhance `API.md` by incorporating explicit references and citations to the relevant official documentation to support each design decision.
- **✓ Fixed:**
  - Added citations to Tauri v2 Command API documentation
  - Added citations to FastAPI Security Documentation
  - Added citations to Tauri's fs API best practices
  - Added citations to Tauri v2 ACL best practices
  - Added documentation for system info examples

## 3. Conclusions and Next Steps

The audit has identified multiple areas of inconsistency between `API.md` and `project-overview.md`, including endpoint naming conventions, HTTP method usage, authentication strategies, error handling, and documentation standards. It is recommended that these issues be reviewed in line with official framework documentation (e.g., FastAPI, REST standards) to establish a uniform API design across the project.

These findings should be discussed in an upcoming review meeting with all stakeholders to decide on the necessary revisions before any further implementation work is undertaken.
