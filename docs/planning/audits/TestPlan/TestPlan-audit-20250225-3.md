# Test Plan Audit Report
**Date:** 2025-02-25
**Auditor:** Cascade AI
**Documents Reviewed:**
- `docs/project-overview.md`
- `docs/planning/TestPlan.md`

## Overview
This audit analyzes the consistency between the Test Plan and the Project Overview document, identifying any misalignments or inconsistencies that need to be addressed.

## Findings

### 1. Testing Framework Inconsistencies
- The Project Overview mentions "Vitest, Playwright for TypeScript" and "tokio-test, mockall, mcp-mock-server for Rust", but the Test Plan includes additional tools not mentioned in the overview:
  - React Testing Library
  - Lighthouse
  - Custom test harness
  - criterion (though this is indirectly referenced in the overview under performance checks)

### 2. Port Configuration Discrepancies
- No inconsistencies found - both documents maintain identical port configurations for services:
  - FastAPI: 8000 (primary), 8001-8003 (supporting)
  - Redis: 6379
  - RabbitMQ: 5672 (AMQP), 15672 (Management)
  - Prometheus: 9090
  - Grafana: 3000

### 3. Performance Metrics Misalignment
- The Project Overview does not specify concrete performance metrics
- The Test Plan introduces specific metrics not mentioned in the overview:
  - Chat message latency < 100ms
  - AI request latency < 500ms
  - These should be validated against project requirements

### 4. Code Coverage Requirements
- The Project Overview does not specify code coverage requirements
- The Test Plan specifies unit test coverage > 80%
- This target should be validated and potentially included in the Project Overview

### 5. UI/UX Testing Reference
- Both documents correctly reference the same UI design files:
  - `AIM_Login_Screen.png`
  - `AIM_Contact_List.png`
  - `AIM_Chat_Window.png`

### 6. Security Testing Scope
- The Test Plan expands significantly on security testing compared to the Project Overview:
  - Adds specific penetration testing requirements
  - Includes more detailed encryption validation steps
  - These additions align with but exceed the overview's security requirements

## Recommendations

1. **Harmonize Testing Tools**
   - Update Project Overview to include all testing tools or justify their exclusion
   - Alternatively, update Test Plan to remove tools not aligned with project strategy

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Add specific performance metrics to Project Overview
   - Or note in Test Plan that metrics are preliminary and subject to change

3. **Code Coverage**
   - Add code coverage requirements to Project Overview if they are indeed project requirements
   - Or mark them as preliminary in Test Plan

4. **Security Testing**
   - Consider expanding security section in Project Overview to match Test Plan's detailed approach
   - Or note in Test Plan which security tests are optional/stretch goals

## Corrections Made

### 1. Harmonize Testing Tools
- Updated Frontend Testing section to mark React Testing Library as supplementary
- Updated Frontend Testing section to mark Lighthouse as optional
- Maintained all tools but clarified their roles in the testing strategy

### 2. Performance Metrics
- Added a "Note" section under Performance Testing
- Clearly marked performance metrics as preliminary
- Added context that metrics are subject to project requirement validation

### 3. Code Coverage
- Added a "Note" section under Code Coverage
- Marked 80% unit test coverage as a proposed target
- Clarified that other coverage requirements are to be determined

### 4. Security Testing
- Restructured Security Testing section into "Core Requirements" and "Recommended Additional Security Measures"
- Maintained comprehensive security approach while clarifying which measures are essential vs. recommended
- Preserved detailed security testing while aligning with project overview's scope

These changes maintain the thorough testing approach while better aligning with the project overview document and clarifying which elements are core requirements versus recommended extensions.

## Conclusion
While there are no critical inconsistencies that would impede project progress, there are several areas where the documents could be better aligned. The Test Plan generally provides more detail than the Project Overview, which is expected, but some key metrics and requirements in the Test Plan should be validated against project requirements and potentially added to the Project Overview for completeness.
