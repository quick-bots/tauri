# TestPlan Audit - 2025-02-25

## Introduction
This document presents an audit comparing the contents of `docs/planning/TestPlan.md` against the `docs/project-overview.md`. The goal is to identify any inconsistencies between the testing plan and the project overview as the planning phase is finalized.

## Audit Methodology
- **Reference Documents:**
  - Project Overview: `docs/project-overview.md`
  - Test Plan: `docs/planning/TestPlan.md`
- **Approach:** Each major section of the Test Plan was compared with the corresponding sections and specifications in the Project Overview. Discrepancies have been noted, with particular attention given to feature descriptions, test scope, and infrastructure settings.

## Findings

### 1. Testing Scope and Feature Coverage
- **Discrepancy in Feature Testing:**
  - The Test Plan includes test cases for features and modules that are either not mentioned or are described differently in the Project Overview. For instance, some specialized tests (e.g., stress testing specific backend services) do not have a corresponding mention in the project overview, which focuses on core functionalities like login, contact lists, and chat windows. 
  - **Assumption:** The Project Overview represents the finalized scope. Any extra tests in the Test Plan should be re-evaluated for relevance or updated to align with the project scope.

### 2. Infrastructure and Port Configurations
- **Port Usage:**
  - The Project Overview clearly specifies primary ports for various services (e.g., FastAPI on 8000 for primary services and 8001-8003 for supporting services, Redis on 6379, RabbitMQ on 5672/15672, etc.). The Test Plan, however, mentions testing scenarios involving alternative or additional ports that could lead to confusion during deployment.
  - **Assumption:** The port configurations in the Project Overview are the prescribed defaults. Any deviations in the Test Plan need to be reconciled with these standards.

### 3. UI/UX and Reference Assets
- **UI Design Consistency:**
  - The Test Plan refers to UI elements and workflows; however, there is inconsistency regarding the use of reference design assets such as `AIM_Login_Screen.png`, `AIM_Contact_List.png`, and `AIM_Chat_Window.png`, which are specified in another documentation source (windsurf-docs/assets). The Test Plan should ensure that any UI-related test cases are aligned with these design references to maintain consistency.

### 4. Documentation and Versioning
- **Document Versioning:**
  - There is a slight discrepancy in versioning and update dates between the Test Plan and Project Overview documents, which may indicate misalignment in updates or an incomplete synchronization of revisions.
  - **Recommendation:** Establish a version control protocol for documentation to ensure all changes in one document are reflected and communicated in the other.

## Corrections Made

### 1. Testing Scope and Feature Coverage
- **Corrections Made**: Removed redundant MCP Integration Testing section as these tests were already covered under Integration Testing and aligned with the Project Overview's scope.
- **Date**: 2025-02-25
- **Status**: Completed

### 2. Infrastructure and Port Configurations
- **Corrections Made**: Added explicit port configurations in both backend testing and integration & security sections:
  - FastAPI services: 8000 (primary), 8001-8003 (supporting services)
  - Redis: 6379
  - RabbitMQ: 5672 (AMQP), 15672 (Management)
  - Prometheus: 9090
  - Grafana: 3000
- Added port availability and service health checks to Performance Testing section
- **Date**: 2025-02-25
- **Status**: Completed

### 3. UI/UX and Reference Assets
- **Corrections Made**: Updated UI/UX testing section to explicitly reference the design assets:
  - Login flow (`AIM_Login_Screen.png`)
  - Main view/buddy list (`AIM_Contact_List.png`)
  - Chat window format (`AIM_Chat_Window.png`)
- **Date**: 2025-02-25
- **Status**: Completed

### 4. Documentation and Versioning
- **Status**: No immediate corrections needed. Version control protocol to be established in future updates.

## Conclusions and Recommendations
- **Realign Testing Scope:** Ensure the Test Plan focuses only on the features and modules defined in the Project Overview unless deliberate extensions are justified.
- **Standardize Port Configurations:** Update the Test Plan to match the official framework port standards as defined in the Project Overview and referenced framework documentation.
- **Harmonize UI Testing References:** Verify that UI tests incorporate the design asset references correctly and uniformly.
- **Review Version Control Practices:** Synchronize documentation versions to prevent future inconsistencies and maintain clarity on the project scope and testing methodology.
