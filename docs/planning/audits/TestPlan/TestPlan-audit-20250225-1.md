# Test Plan Audit Report - 2025-02-25

## Inconsistencies Found

### 1. Testing Tool Version Conflicts
- **TestPlan.md** references:
  - Tauri v2
  - Next.js (unspecified version)
  - MCP v1.2.0
- **project-overview.md** specifies:
  - Tauri v2.1.0 (explicit minor version)
  - Next.js 14.1.0
  - MCP v1.3.0-rc2

### 2. Security Scanning Discrepancies
- project-overview.md mandates **MCP Inspector** which is absent from TestPlan

### 3. Performance Metrics
**NOTE: This section has been invalidated.** The performance metrics comparison was incorrect as project-overview.md does not specify explicit metrics for AI Response Latency, Concurrent Users, or Memory Usage. This section should be disregarded.

### 4. Missing MCP Integration Tests
TestPlan lacks specific validation for:
- MCP protocol-level sandboxing
- Multi-model context switching
- Ephemeral session handling

## Recommended Actions
1. Add explicit version numbers for core technologies in TestPlan.md
2. Add MCP Inspector to security testing suite
3. ~~Update performance targets to match primary spec~~ (REMOVED - primary spec does not define specific metrics)
4. Add missing MCP integration test cases

## Changes Made
The following corrections have been applied to TestPlan.md:

1. Added MCP Inspector to security testing tools
2. Added MCP integration test cases for:
   - Protocol-level sandboxing
   - Multi-model context switching
   - Ephemeral session handling
