# SRS Audit Report - 2025-02-24 (Audit #2)

## Overview
This document provides a detailed audit of the SRS document (`docs/planning/SRS.md`) by comparing its requirements and specifications with the Project Overview (`docs/project-overview.md`). The findings below highlight inconsistencies that need to be addressed to ensure both documents align with the projectâ€™s overall vision and framework guidelines.

## Audit Findings

### 1. Scope and Objectives
- **Project Overview:** Emphasizes a unified vision focusing on an AIM-inspired UI/UX design that incorporates modern best practices. It stresses consistency in service port configurations and integration of critical design assets (e.g., login flow, main view, chat window).
- **SRS Document:** Contains additional functionality and feature requirements that are either not mentioned or are differently prioritized compared to the Overview. For instance, there are references to supplementary services and alternative interaction flows that are not documented in the Project Overview.

*Recommendation:* Reconcile the scope by ensuring that all SRS features directly align with the broader project intent stated in the project overview. Any additional features should be clearly justified with reference to official framework documentation.

*Changes Made:*
  - Added explicit references to design assets in System Context section
  - Removed alternative interaction flows not present in Project Overview
  - Aligned service configurations with framework standards

### 2. UI/UX Design Consistency
- **Project Overview:** Clearly references the AIM-inspired design and includes assets located in the `windsurf-docs/assets` directory (e.g., `AIM_Login_Screen.png`, `AIM_Contact_List.png`, `AIM_Chat_Window.png`) as design standards.
- **SRS Document:** Lacks explicit alignment with these referenced design assets. Some UI requirements appear to diverge (e.g., different layout suggestions or interaction patterns that do not match the AIM references).

*Recommendation:* Update the SRS document to explicitly align its UI/UX requirements with the provided reference assets. This ensures consistency of design and adherence to the documented best practices.

*Changes Made:*
  - Added explicit references to design assets for each UI component (Login, Main View, Chat Windows)
  - Updated UI requirements to directly reference the corresponding design files
  - Ensured UI feature descriptions match the provided design assets

### 3. Technical Specifications
- **Project Overview:** Imposes strict port standards and service configurations (e.g., FastAPI services, Redis, RabbitMQ, Prometheus, Grafana) as part of the framework authority guidelines.
- **SRS Document:** There are discrepancies in the technical details such as port assignments and integration setups. Some service configurations in the SRS do not match the official recommendations provided in the project overview and global framework authority memory.

*Recommendation:* Cross-check and update all technical specifications in the SRS so that they are consistent with the established port standards and service configurations as listed in the Project Overview and the global framework authority guidelines.

*Changes Made:*
  - Added comprehensive port configuration section under System Architecture
  - Aligned all service ports with framework standards
  - Documented standard ports for FastAPI, Redis, RabbitMQ, Prometheus, and Grafana
  - Added detailed Core Technologies section with Frontend Stack, Backend Stack, and Recommended Tauri Plugins
  - Enhanced testing requirements with specific tools and coverage metrics
  - Added comprehensive MCP integration requirements section

### 4. Feature Prioritization and Justification
- **Project Overview:** Prioritizes a streamlined, AIM-inspired communication system with a strong emphasis on security, performance, and design consistency.
- **SRS Document:** Introduces features that lack explicit justification, and in some cases, the priority given to these features might dilute the primary project objectives. There is insufficient reference to official documentation or framework recommendations for these additional features.

*Recommendation:* Reassess and document the rationale behind every feature in the SRS. Ensure that each feature is backed by official framework recommendations or is clearly marked as an innovation with appropriate justification. This will help in resolving conflicts between SRS features and the project's core requirements.

*Changes Made:*
  - Realigned feature priorities to match Project Overview objectives
  - Removed features not explicitly supported by framework documentation
  - Enhanced documentation of core AIM-inspired features
  - Added explicit technical stack choices with justifications
  - Expanded testing and quality assurance requirements
  - Added detailed MCP integration specifications

## Additional Improvements Made
1. **Technology Stack Documentation**
   - Added comprehensive frontend technology stack details
   - Included specific backend dependencies and their purposes
   - Listed recommended Tauri plugins with their functions

2. **Testing Framework Enhancement**
   - Separated frontend and backend testing requirements
   - Added specific testing tools and methodologies
   - Included CI/CD requirements and quality gates
   - Specified minimum test coverage requirements

3. **MCP Integration Details**
   - Added dedicated MCP integration requirements section
   - Detailed core components and features
   - Specified security considerations
   - Aligned with Project Overview's MCP architecture

## Conclusion
The SRS document has been significantly enhanced to align more closely with the Project Overview's technical specifications and architectural guidelines. The additions provide clearer direction for implementation while maintaining consistency with the project's core vision. Key improvements include detailed technology stack documentation, comprehensive testing requirements, and explicit MCP integration specifications.

Addressing these discrepancies will ensure that both planning documents effectively communicate a unified project strategy and that implementation efforts are streamlined. Future revisions should include explicit citations and references to official guidelines to support every technical decision.
