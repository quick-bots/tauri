# SRS Document Audit Report
Date: 2025-02-24
Scope: Consistency check between `project-overview.md` and `planning/SRS.md`

## Executive Summary
This audit compares the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) against the project overview document to identify any inconsistencies or misalignments. The review focuses on technical specifications, architectural decisions, and implementation details.

## Identified Inconsistencies

### 1. Frontend Technology Stack
- **Project Overview**: Explicitly specifies "Tailwind CSS or shadcn/ui" for UI components
- **SRS**: No mention of specific UI component frameworks in the technical requirements
- **Impact**: Medium - Could lead to implementation inconsistencies
- **Recommendation**: Add UI framework requirements to SRS Section 4.4 (Usability)
    - ✓ Added UI framework requirements specifying Tailwind CSS and/or shadcn/ui in Section 4.4

### 2. State Management
- **Project Overview**: Explicitly specifies Zustand for global state management
- **SRS**: No mention of state management requirements or solutions
- **Impact**: Medium - Critical architectural decision missing from requirements
- **Recommendation**: Add state management requirements to SRS Section 3.1 (User Interface)
    - ✓ Added state management specification (Zustand) in Section 4.4 under User Experience

### 3. Testing Framework Specifications
- **Project Overview**: Specifies Vitest, Playwright, tokio-test, mockall, and mcp-mock-server
- **SRS**: No explicit testing requirements or quality assurance frameworks mentioned
- **Impact**: High - Missing critical quality assurance requirements
- **Recommendation**: Add new section under Non-Functional Requirements for Testing/QA requirements
    - ✓ Added new Section 4.5 "Testing and Quality Assurance" with comprehensive testing requirements

### 4. Performance Metrics Discrepancy
- **Project Overview**: No specific performance metrics defined
- **SRS**: Defines specific metrics (e.g., app startup < 3s, chat latency < 100ms)
- **Impact**: Low - SRS provides more detail, which is appropriate
- **Recommendation**: No action needed; SRS appropriately expands on performance requirements
    - ✓ No changes required

### 5. Database Technology
- **Project Overview**: Mentions both "sqlx / sled" as options
- **SRS**: Only mentions "SQLite or similar" without specifying sled as an option
- **Impact**: Medium - Potential implementation confusion
- **Recommendation**: Align database options in SRS with project overview
    - ✓ Updated Section 2.2 to explicitly mention both SQLite and sled as database options

### 6. Animation Requirements
- **Project Overview**: Specifies Framer Motion for animations
- **SRS**: No mention of animation requirements or performance criteria
- **Impact**: Low - Feature-level detail
- **Recommendation**: Add animation requirements to SRS Section 4.4 (Usability)
    - ✓ Added animation requirements specifying Framer Motion in Section 4.4

## Structural Alignment
Both documents maintain good overall structural alignment in terms of:
- Core technologies (Tauri v2, Next.js, Rust)
- Security considerations and ACL implementation
- MCP integration approach
- AIM-inspired UI/UX direction

## Recommendations Summary

1. Update SRS to include:
   - Specific UI framework requirements
   - State management specifications
   - Testing and QA requirements
   - Database technology options
   - Animation requirements

2. Consider adding a new section to SRS for Developer Tooling requirements to match the detail level in the project overview.

3. Maintain the current level of detail for performance metrics in the SRS, as it appropriately expands on the project overview's high-level goals.

## Conclusion
While there are no critical conflicts between the documents, several areas need alignment to ensure consistent implementation. The SRS generally provides appropriate detail for requirements but should be updated to include key technical decisions documented in the project overview.
