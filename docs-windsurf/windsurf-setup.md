## 1. Project Overview

This desktop application will integrate **local AI/ML capabilities** while also leveraging **external foundational AI models** for tasks such as summarization and conversational interactions. The front end and user experience will take cues from **AOL Instant Messenger (AIM)**—focusing on a **lightweight, chat-based** interaction model. This approach suits use cases in which users monitor multiple “agents,” gather real-time updates, and need minimal disruption to their workflow.

**Key highlights:**
- **Cross-platform** support: Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Compact, efficient** user interface based on AIM design principles.
- **Local AI inference** (e.g., ONNX Runtime, Rust NLP libraries) combined with **secure external AI model** usage.
- Strong emphasis on **security**, including cryptographic standards, data encryption, and compliance with industry regulations (e.g., for financial or sensitive data).
- Modular and **future-ready** architecture.

---

## 2. Key Objectives

1. **Cross-Platform Deployment**  
   Deliver a single Tauri-based desktop application that runs seamlessly across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

2. **AI Integration**  
   - **Local Inference:** Ability to run ONNX models or Rust-based NLP for offline tasks.  
   - **External Models:** Securely invoke third-party APIs for specialized tasks (e.g., large-scale summarization, advanced language modeling).

3. **Security & Maintainability**  
   - Employ **strong cryptographic standards** for data storage and network communication.  
   - Ensure maintainable code by leveraging Rust’s memory safety, Next.js for the frontend, and well-structured project organization.

4. **Enhanced User Experience**  
   - Provide an **AIM-inspired** interface that is familiar, compact, and easy to navigate.  
   - Offer **real-time updates** for CRM data, AI agent status, and relevant tasks.

5. **Scalable Architecture**  
   - Establish a clear **Clean Architecture** that supports future expansions, new features, and plugin integrations.

## 3. UI/UX Inspiration

Drawing on **AOL Instant Messenger (AIM)** of the early 2000s, the application’s interface will follow these guiding principles:

- **Compact Window Layout:** Minimizes screen space usage, allowing users to keep the application running alongside other windows.
- **Familiar Chat Metaphor:** Real-time “chat” or messaging with AI agents.
- **Status Indicators:** Each agent’s current state (online, offline, processing, etc.) is immediately visible.
- **Categorized Agent Lists:** Organize agents into collapsible categories (e.g., “Active Agents,” “CRM Integration,” “System Agents”).
- **Efficient Navigation:** Quick search/filter for agents, real-time messages, tasks, and deals/pipelines.

**Core Views:**

6. **Login View**  
   - Username/password fields (with “Forgot Password” and “Save Password” options).  
   - Version info display and user registration link.

7. **Main View (Agent List)**  
   - Collapsible categories grouping AI agents by function or status.  
   - Simple search/filter box for quick agent lookups.  
   - Status indicators (online/offline, active tasks).

8. **Chat View**  
   - Text input area with formatting options (bold, italics, etc.).  
   - Timestamped message history.  
   - Real-time activity indicators.  
   - Optional CRM updates or “task results” displayed inline.

9. **Additional Views**  
   - **Customer List:** Overview of all customer records (if integrated with CRM).  
   - **Deals/Pipeline View:** Track deals or tasks across various stages.  
   - **God View:** High-level dashboard showing system performance metrics, agent logs, and real-time CRM updates.

## 11. Design Reference Files
To provide Windsurf AI with clear visual guidance for the AOL Instant Messenger–inspired design, we have included three reference images in the repository. These images are located in the `windsurf-docs/assets` folder.

1. **AIM_Login_Screen.png**  
   - **Purpose**: Illustrates the classic AIM login flow, including screen name/password entry and “Save Password” checkbox.  
   - **Usage**: Use this image to replicate a simple, nostalgic login layout and to understand minimal UI elements required.

2. **AIM_Contact_List.png**  
   - **Purpose**: Shows the compact buddy list interface with collapsible categories and status icons.  
   - **Usage**: Reference this layout for designing our “Main View” (agent list) with online/offline indicators and collapsible sections.

3. **AIM_Chat_Window.png**  
   - **Purpose**: Depicts the chat window format with text input area, timestamped messages, and status icons.  
   - **Usage**: Use this image as a guide for building the “Chat View,” focusing on message alignment, timestamps, and streamlined user interaction.

### Instructions for Windsurf AI

When implementing the UI, please refer to these images as **style guides** for:
- **Layout and Spacing**: Notice how the original AIM interface keeps a tight, minimal structure that does not waste screen space.
- **Color Schemes**: Extract relevant color palettes and subtle design elements if they match our overall theme. However, feel free to modernize them as needed (e.g., flatter icons, updated fonts).
- **Feature Placement**: Understand where key items (e.g., status indicators, search bars, chat input boxes) should appear for maximum user familiarity.

These images are intended purely for **design reference** and to capture the nostalgic feel of AIM. We encourage modern best practices (e.g., Tailwind CSS, responsive layouts, etc.) while retaining the core look and feel suggested by these AIM screenshots.
